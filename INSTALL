In order to build the OMCLPBoost package, you need to install these libraries:

* libconfig: C/C++ Configuration File Library
  http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/
  Version used for this package: 1.4.4

* Eigen2: C++ template library for linear algebra
  http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
  Version used for this package: 2.0.12

After installing the dependencies, just run the "make" to compile with g++ or "make TARGET=arm" to cross-compile for ARM.

This should build the "OrbitAI_OMCBoost" binary.
